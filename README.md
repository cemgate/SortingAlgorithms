# SortingAlgorithms
## Polish Project description
Plik "PROJECT REPORT" to sprawozdanie z ca≈Çego projektu.

## Project description 
The project focuses on sorting movies based on their rankings (rating from 1 to 10) using three sorting algorithms: 
 - merge sort
 - quick sort 
 - bucket sort
 
 The program reads a data file containing the names of the movies and their corresponding ratings. The movies and ratings are then loaded into a vector of structures. 
 The movie structure contains a field for the name and rating.

The program allows the user to choose the number of movies to sort, either 10,000, 100,000, or all movies. The program then sorts the data using the selected sorting algorithms and displays the sorting time for each algorithm.

The project uses standard C++ libraries and works on multiple platforms. The source code contains detailed comments and user instructions.

## Youtubue Video 
Here is the link to the YouTube video that demonstrates how the program works.
Im really sorry but my program to record was some trash and colours on video are really bugged. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eue6SCw7kSs&ab_channel=MarcinCichocki)

## Conclusion 
The user can use this project to learn how different sorting algorithms work and how to implement them in C++. 
The project can also be expanded with additional sorting algorithms or features, such as displaying the sorted movies in a specific order or allowing the user to search for a specific movie based on its name or rating.

The project uses the following standard libraries

-iostream
-fstream
-vector
-string
-algorithm
-chrono.
